    <p><strong>Current demo version: 0.2.6</strong>: Basic collision detection; AABB outlines.</p>
    <p>My main goal is to help reinforce my own game engine creation ideas and fundamentals. I have tried to be as clear as possible in order to cater to a wider range of prior knowledge if others come seeking info.</p>
    <p>If you're just here for updates to the game, head on over to the <strong>demo</strong> section for the lastest compilation of the game.</p>
    <p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> not every demo is going to be a playable game. Most are going to be tests for the most recently added part of the game engine.</em></p>
    <p><em><strong>ALSO NOTE:</strong> using a mobile device is cool. Party Horse isn't that cool yet. There will be no response to touch events unfortunately...yet</em></p>
    <p><strong>Documentation</strong> of the ph-engine will be available as soon as I nail down the core mechanics of the engine.</p>
    <p>Same goes for the engine <strong>source</strong>. I'll update those sections when the game is further along as there will be many rapid changes.</p>

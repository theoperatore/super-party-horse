Origins
-------

This blog exists for the sole purpose to explaining my thought processes when coding the game engine used specifically for this game. Hopefully it'll help some wanderer figure out a game design related problem of their own. The concepts in this engine (or game) aren't very complex so it is my hope that everything is concise.

The inspiration for this game came from a real-life problem. My sister recently took a trip to the country of Belize to help and learn conservation efforts of the wildlife. While there she heard about the jaguar problems that some livestock farmers encounter.

Think about it. If you're a jaguar and hungry, how could you pass up easy prey? I mean, come on, the cows are just sitting there in their pasture...looking....so.....*tasty*...and *free*...

As a wildlife conservationist you generally do not want the farmer to just *shoot* the jaguar. That isn't good for the jaguar population, but on the other hand there has to be some solution that will protect the farmer's livestock too.

Turns out, according to my sister, there are two solutions that work really well depending on the size of the farm. If the farm is small just build a fence. It keeps out the jaguars and protects the cows. Simple.

If the farm is large, you'd need a really large fence and that just isn't feasible. Instead, the wildlife conservationists will get you...

**A DONKEY**!

Problem solved. Donkeys are loud. Jaguars don't like loud; they get scared by loud. Hence the idea for this game: Player is a Donkey trying to protect the farm's livestock from the evil jaguars.

But what is this Party Horse business you ask?

Good question. I've played my fair share of Dungeons & Dragons. During one campaign my group needed to get to another town and decided to purchase horses. Since I was a gnome, my friend was a halfling, and my sister could turn into a cat, all three of us decided to ride on one fullsize horse together. Thus **PARTY HORSE** was born from the unending party the three of us would have on the back of this horse.

Party Horse was such a great concept that we drew a picture that got out of control. Party Horse had really cool features that any normal horse should definitely want,/have: slinky knees, strobe light eyes, a smoke machine butt, glowstick mane, spinners, brass knuckles(hooves), subwoofers built into the hindquarters of the horse, and a saddle fashioned out of an infinite supply of beer.

He was truely a sight to behold.

Legends tell of Party Horse having different super powers as well: the ability to speak and understand any language and fly.

Here is where the game starts to form. As time goes on, you can 'upgrade' your Donkey with various abilities and upgrades as he slowly becomes the Party Horse of legend.

*PROTECT THE COWS AND DEFEAT THE JAGWARS!*

Source and Posts
----------------

All of the source will be hosted as a repo on github eventually and the demo section of the site will have the most current demo of the game.

Topics (as defined in this game) that I want to cover include (in no particular order):

- Sprite Animation
- Collision Detection
- Image Pre-Loading
- Verlet / Runge-Kutta Integration
- Game Loop Optimization
- Artificial Intelligence
- Rendering Order
- Input Handling
- Game states

Of course the list is subject to change based on anything else that comes up that is interesting enough to write about.
